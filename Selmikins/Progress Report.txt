	- Installations done:
		- Create project repository, shared with Loic and installed Git on PC and Mac to share repository with starting files
		- Download Eclipse Temurin JDK with Hotspot 16.0.2+7
		- Download logisim-evolution 3.7.2
		- Download Quartus Prime Lite
		- Revamp USB Blaster

07.03.2024
	- Ran Circuit example on DE10lite
	- Read through circuit code & TPs

10.03.2024
	- Learned the basics of Quartus
	- Researched possible UART implementations
	- Looked at basics of VHDL vs. Verilog
	
12.03.2024
	- Translated Hildebrand's verilog UART code into VHDL
	- Tried adding end of Toni's code to have an input/output signal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmcSpgOtJ4
	

13.03.2024	
	- Mapped inputs/outputs of original Hildebrand VHDL code (without Toni's part), only status info worked
	- Tried implementing Nandland version of UART with testbench, complications in wait statements (tried replacing with state machines, more errors in signaling)
	- Download RealTerm Serial Capture Program
	- Download WaveForms
	- To do:
		- Understand basics of UART inputs/outputs to do so
		- As a result better implement Toni's code
		- Look into RealTerm Serial Capture Program

Partie 1: test bench, test oscilloscope (quartus et logisim) sur TX, puis eventuellement RX, apres faire un echo sur realterm: tp7 microcontroleurs, Tout est traduit sur logisim et optimise 

23.03.2024
	- Create basic instruction on logisim to get current through the oscilloscope, test on WaveForms: Done. 
	To Do:
	- Test bench on TX on quartus through oscilloscope as well? Closer look at what bench actually does.
